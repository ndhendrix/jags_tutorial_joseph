This tutorial uses `JAGS` and one of its `R` interfaces (`rjags`) to estimate prevalence and test characteristics from one or two diagnostic tests in the absence of a gold standard.

It comprises a guided replication of the paper ["Bayesian estimate of disease prevalence and parameters of diagnostic tests in the absence of a gold standard"](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/Joseph/publications/methodological/diagtest.pdf).

The three files are identical in their code, but the RMarkdown and PDF files also contain explanatory text.
